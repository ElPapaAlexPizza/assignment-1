				<h2>My Background</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>My formal education has been through RMIT in the IT field. Having moved around particular areas of IT in the workforce ranging from - Web Design and Development, IT Solutions, Search Engine Optimisation, etc.</p>
					<p>First IT job started when I was in my late teens, and have been in IT ever since still bouncing around different areas.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>My highest achievment as of right now is highschool graduation.</br>
					During highschool, I attempted to learn as much as I could about computers from my information technology teacher, constantly looking upto him as he was my main source of knowledge. Most of what I know about computerised technology comes from him and I can't thank him enough.</br>
					</p>
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>Most of my hobbies are computer related, i grew up around technology and playing games and it really sparked my interests towards how they work, making me want to learn more and more every day.</p>
					<p>A lot of my acquaintances are also very fascinated by computerised technology, and occasionally we spend time sharing things we have learnt to help broaden our knowledge.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>My ideal job is something that can keep me focussed and pressure me to push myself passed my limits.</p>
			<p>But ideally, i've always been interested in having a career in some sort of IT field. I have grown up around computers and they have become a part of my daily lifestyle. I've always enjoyed learning and branching my knowledge in this field and seeing what more I can achieve.</p>
